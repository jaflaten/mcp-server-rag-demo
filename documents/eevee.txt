Eevee is a Normal-type Pokemon famous for its unstable genetic code that allows it to evolve into eight different forms. Each evolution, called an Eeveelution, represents a different type: Vaporeon (Water), Jolteon (Electric), Flareon (Fire), Espeon (Psychic), Umbreon (Dark), Leafeon (Grass), Glaceon (Ice), and Sylveon (Fairy). Eevee's evolution is triggered by various methods including evolutionary stones, friendship, location, and knowing specific moves. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice among trainers.
