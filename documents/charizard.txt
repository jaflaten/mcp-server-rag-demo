Charizard is a Fire/Flying-type Pokemon that resembles a large dragon. It breathes fire that can melt boulders and is known for seeking out powerful opponents. Charizard is the final evolution of Charmander, evolving from Charmeleon at level 36. Its flames burn hotter when it has experienced harsh battles. Charizard can Mega Evolve into two different forms: Mega Charizard X, which becomes Fire/Dragon-type, and Mega Charizard Y, which has enhanced special attack.
