Scizor is a Bug/Steel-type Pokemon that evolved from Scyther when traded holding a Metal Coat. Its body transformed into steel-hard armor, though it became slower. Scizor's pincers contain powerful muscles and can crush any hard object. It has compound eyes that can spot prey from great distances. Scizor can Mega Evolve into Mega Scizor, which has larger pincers and even greater attack power. Despite its heavy appearance, Scizor can fly using the wings on its back, though not as gracefully as Scythe
