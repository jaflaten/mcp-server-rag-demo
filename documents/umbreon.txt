Umbreon is a Dark-type Pokemon that evolved from Eevee through high friendship at night. It has the ability to spray poisonous sweat when agitated and its body rings glow when it's ready to attack. Umbreon lurks in darkness waiting for prey and can blend perfectly into the night. Its eyes glow yellow in the dark, striking fear into opponents. Umbreon has high defensive stats and is known for its strategic battling style. The moon's influence caused Eevee to develop this unique evolution.
