Bulbasaur is a Grass/Poison-type Pokemon with a plant bulb on its back. The bulb grows larger as the Pokemon absorbs nutrients and sunlight. It is one of the three starter Pokemon in the Kanto region. Bulbasaur can perform photosynthesis and stays close to sunny areas. At level 16, it evolves into Ivysaur, and at level 32, it becomes Venusaur. The bulb on its back contains a seed that was planted there at birth.
