Snorlax is a Normal-type Pokemon known for its enormous appetite and constant sleeping. It weighs over 1,000 pounds and blocks roads while sleeping. Snorlax eats approximately 900 pounds of food per day and won't stop eating until it's consumed enough. Despite its lazy appearance, Snorlax is quite strong in battle. It evolves from Munchlax when leveled up with high friendship. Its stomach can digest any kind of food, even moldy or rotten items, without getting sick.
