Greninja is a Water/Dark-type Pokemon known for its ninja-like speed and stealth. It can compress water into throwing stars and move with such speed that it appears invisible. Greninja evolves from Frogadier at level 36 and is the final evolution of Froakie. It has a unique ability called Battle Bond that allows it to transform into Ash-Greninja when it defeats an opponent. Greninja's tongue wraps around its neck like a scarf, and it uses this in combat as well. It creates throwing stars from compressed water.
