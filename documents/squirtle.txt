Squirtle is a Water-type Pokemon with a blue body and a brown shell on its back. It can spray water from its mouth with great accuracy and uses its shell for protection. Squirtle is known as the Tiny Turtle Pokemon and is one of the Kanto starter Pokemon. It evolves into Wartortle at level 16 and then into Blastoise at level 36. When it retracts into its shell, it can reduce damage from attacks. Squirtle's shell is not just for protection but also helps it swim faster.
