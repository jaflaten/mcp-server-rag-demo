Garchomp is a Dragon/Ground-type Pokemon that resembles a land shark. It can move at incredibly high speeds and is known for its fierce battling abilities. Garchomp evolves from Gabite at level 48 and is the final evolution of Gible. Its body was designed for speed, and it can fly as fast as a jet plane. Garchomp can Mega Evolve into Mega Garchomp, though some trainers prefer its base form due to its higher speed stat. The fins on its body are sharp enough to cut through steel.
